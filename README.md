In this project I have created a modern full-stack reference app named DogCollector. 

## User Stories 
* As a user (AAU), when I click the "View All My Dogs" link, I want to see a page listing all of my dogs with their name, age, breed, and a little description of them.
* AAU, I want to see a navigation bar for "Add a Dog" and when I click on that I should be able to add a new dog to the database. 
*  AAU, when viewing a dog's detail page, I want to click EDIT to update that dog's information.
* AAU, when viewing a dog's detail page, I want to click DELETE to remove that dog from the database. 

## Technologies Used
* Django
* PostgreSQL 
* Python 
* Materialize CSS Framework 
* Django Template Language (DTL)
