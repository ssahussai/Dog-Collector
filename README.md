In this project I have created a modern full-stack reference app named DogCollector. 

## User Stories 
* As a user (AAU), when I land in the app I should be able to see an option ether to Sign Up or Log In. 
    * I should also see a navigation bar and be able to go to "About" page that tells me about the app and how to use it.
* AAU, I want to have a user profile based on the login information. 
* AAU,  in the "View All Dog" page, I want  to see a list of all my dogs. I want to make sure the dogs belong to me, a user, and I am able to have many dogs in my collection. 
* AAU, after I log in, I want to see a page listing all of my dogs with their name, age, breed, and a little description of them.
* AAU, I want to see a navigation bar for "Add a Dog" and when I click on that I should be able to add a new dog to the database. 
* AAU, when viewing a dog's detail page, I want to click EDIT to update that dog's information.
* AAU, when viewing a dog's detail page, I want to click DELETE to remove that dog from the database. 
* AAU, I should be able to track the dog meals such as breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I want to see a message whether a god is hungry or has been feed. If a dog is hungry, I should be able to feed it it's daily meals.  
* AAU, when viewing the detail page of the dog, I want to see a list of toys the dog has and be able to add toys to the list that he dog doesn't already have. 
* AAU, I should be able to add image(s) for the dog(s) in the "details" page of that dog. If there are no images for the dog, I want to see a message saying "No Photos Uploaded" and be able to see a form underneath with options to upload images.
